1. Pull down the docker image from DockerHub: cmusvsc/soc-fall-2015-team18:latest

2. Pull down the code from GitHub: cmusv-sc/SOC-Fall-2015-Team18-Lead-Xin-Wan and note down the path to your project folder.

3. Start your docker terminal and run following command to start the docker image: docker run -it -p 9234:9000 -p 9035:9034 -v <Path_to_your_project>:/home/SOC-Fall-2015/Dev cmusvsc/soc-fall-2015-team18:latest

4. Cd into the project folder:
cd /home/SOC-Fall-2015/Dev/SOC-Fall-2015

5. If you want to start another terminal to avoid using screen command: try running this on your docker terminal:
docker exec -i -t <Docker instance id> bash
Then it will show up as your second terminal for the same docker instance.
You can access your docker instance id by looking into your first started docker terminal, it will show up as:
root@ca138e32509f:
Here the String ca138e32509f is your docker instance id.

6. Here you work on the docker container (an instance of the docker image). First start your mysql service by running:
	service mysql start

7. Then cd into your Backend folder:
	cd /home/SOC-Fall-2015/Dev/SOC-Fall-2015/ApacheCMDA-Backend
	And run your backend:
	./activator “run 9034”

8. Cd into your Frontend folder:
	cd /home/SOC-Fall-2015/Dev/SOC-Fall-2015/ApacheCMDA-Frontend
	And run your frontend:
	./activator run
9. Open your web browser on your machine, as we redirected the port 9000 on our docker container to port 9234 on our own machine, open http://localhost:9234/ in your browser and wait for the frontend code to finish compiling.

10. Trigger the backend code to compile by clicking on the ‘service list’ option in the service tab.

11. Wait for the service list to show up, then the project is running successfully.
